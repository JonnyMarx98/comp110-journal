## When does a physical system compute? 
I found this paper very hard to understand but I believe I understand the basic idea of it. The paper explains when a physical system computes. It goes very in depth and uses a lot of physics, which I didn't understand very well, to explain how abstract and physical entities link using the representation relation. The representation relation is explained in the paper and says that "such a representation allows comparisons to be made between physical processes and mathematically described computations". There were many diagrams showing the relationship between abstract and physical entities which made it a bit clearer to me. From what I understand, In a computer the program/algorithm is the abstract entity and the physical hardware of the computer is the physical entity. So we create the abstract computation and the computer represents it using the physical components.   
I found the paper highly confusing and hard to understand, however I still believe I learnt a lot about  how the physical and abstract levels of a computation connect through the representation relation.
